	<h1>Shipping</h1>

	<p>
		Crampa is a small company and because we don't have the ability to stock large amounts of products, order processing times
		will vary depending on your order. When ordered products are in stock we can usually get those out in 1 day. Larger orders,
		or orders that include items that are currently being manufactured, shall be discussed regarding the terms of delivery.
	</p>

	<p>
		Please note that residents of some countries may have to pay customs or import duty charges on their order.  You are responsible
		for any customs or import duty charges you may incur. If you choose not to pay these charges, your package will not be
		released by customs. In this event, we will be unable to offer you a refund.  EU residents will not have to pay any customs
		or import duties.
